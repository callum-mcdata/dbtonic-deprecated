## The I Don't Know Folder

I am not a software engineer. 

I do not know how to structure things well.

This folder is the equivalent of the broom closet. 

Found some old manuals for a rice cooker that you don't know if you can get
rid of? Broom closet. Have some random util functions that don't __feel__ like 
they should live in some other folder? Broom closet.

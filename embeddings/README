## This Code
You may be wondering - what is python doing in this Rust repo? Well you've found my secret: 
I don't really know how to use Rust that well! Thankfully ChatGPT exists and so this section
of the codebase is my attempt to use it in order to supplement my own knowledge while also
messing around with langchain. 

The goal of this section of the repo is to create an embedding of all the sqlparser-rs
codebase so that I can provide the relevant pieces of info to the questions I ask.

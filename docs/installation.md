## Installing dbtonic

Right now, `dbtonic` only exists as a Rust library. In order to install it you will need to clone the repo to your local computer and then install it. 

To **clone the repo** you can run:
```
git clone https://github.com/callum-mcdata/dbtonic.git
```

Once you've cloned the repo, navigate to the folder where it exists and run the following command.
```
cargo install --path .
```

Now you will be able to run `dbtonic` commands from your command line!

In the original Python implementation, you have a metaclass _Tokenizer and a class Tokenizer. The metaclass _Tokenizer is responsible for initializing and modifying the class attributes when the Tokenizer class is created. This is a more advanced and less common pattern in Python, but it's useful for customizing class creation.

In Rust, there isn't a direct equivalent to Python metaclasses. However, we can achieve similar functionality by initializing all the necessary fields in the Tokenizer struct and providing a new method to create an instance of the Tokenizer struct.

Let's walk through how the Python implementation works and how we can adapt it to Rust:

The _Tokenizer metaclass has a __new__ method, which is called when the Tokenizer class is created. In this method, it initializes several dictionaries and sets based on the class attributes defined in the Tokenizer class.

The _delimeter_list_to_dict static method is used to create dictionaries from lists containing strings or tuples of strings.

The KEYWORD_TRIE is created by combining several dictionaries containing keywords, comments, quotes, bit strings, hex strings, and byte strings. It's then filtered to include only those keys that contain a space or any single tokens.

The Tokenizer class has several class-level attributes (e.g., SINGLE_TOKENS, BIT_STRINGS, HEX_STRINGS, etc.) that are used by the metaclass to initialize the dictionaries and sets mentioned earlier.

Now, let's see how we can adapt this to Rust:

Instead of a metaclass, we'll create a Tokenizer struct and define all the fields necessary to store the dictionaries and sets.

We'll write a new method for the Tokenizer struct that will be responsible for initializing all the fields. In this method, we can create HashMaps and HashSets with the appropriate values.

Since Rust doesn't support dictionary comprehension like Python, we can use loops, iterators, and the collect method to create HashMaps and HashSets.

We will have to make sure that all the necessary fields are initialized in the new method, as there won't be any class-level attributes like in Python. This means that the initial values of the fields in the Rust implementation need to be hardcoded in the new method.

By following these steps, we can convert the Python implementation to idiomatic Rust code. It's important to understand that the Rust implementation might not be a direct one-to-one translation due to differences in language features and design, but it will still provide the same functionality.
